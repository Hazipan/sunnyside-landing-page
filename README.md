### What I learned

I learned how to incorperate vanilla JS into my web design. I've used React, but this is the first time using plain JS for me. It was very educational

### Continued development

I'm going to continue working on projects from Frontend Mentor with a focus on responsive design. I want to get better with mobile design, as well as website interactivity.
